CNC-calc description
================================================================================

This project contains a small app for doing calculations in g-code for
cnc machines. The idea is to copy a small snippet of code from an editor that
contains the cnc file and paste it into the left app window. The calculations
are done on the code in the left window and the result is output in the right
window. 

If more operations are to be done it will have to be copy-pasted back into the
left window again.

After calculations are ready the result can be copied from the right window
back into the original cnc-code editor.
